## [](#header-2)Value-Centric Product Management

In 2017, we took a trip to Italy discussing about how to enable data-based, value-centric product management to drive key business metrics more sustainably. We designed a measurement framework that describes how features deliver on each of the dimensions in which a product creates user value. The resulting MVP was Product Hour, a format to help startups with product problems while calibrating our framework. ([read more](http://vcpm.org/))

## [](#header-2)MBA World Summit

In 2016, we helped the [MBA World Summit](http://mbaworldsummit.com/) to double the number of applications and cut internal application handling efforts by 40% by building an application platform incl. payment integration and analyzing visitor behavior to reallocate marketing campaign budgets. Check it out [here](http://admissions.mbaworldsummit.com/).

## [](#header-2)Junto

On a hackathon in 2016, we built a social habit tracking app for fun. It has since gathered a small but active community of users.

## [](#header-2)Appoint

In 2015, a handful of us decided to spend a weekend in Prague trying to simplify the pain in the ass that often starts when 3+ people try to agree on a date and time an appointment (Motto: fuck the maybes.) We failed. While users validated the 'appoint problem', the functional prototype we built during the weekend was not radically improving things.

## [](#header-2)Johnson Controls

In 2014, we helped Johnson Controls define a new product vision that radically prioritized customer needs. Two years later, the resulting industry-first product was presented at the world's leading trade show for industrial technology in Hannover ([read more](http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/de_de/-/media/jci/be/germany/chillers/files/be_ykwkk_brochure_de.pdf?la=de)).
