## [](#header-2)MBA World Summit

In 2016, we helped the [MBA World Summit](http://mbaworldsummit.com/) to double the number of applications and cut internal application handling efforts by 40% by building an application platform incl. payment integration and analyzing visitor behavior to reallocate marketing campaign budgets. Check it out [here](http://admissions.mbaworldsummit.com/).


## [](#header-2)Junto

On a hackathon in 2016, we built a social habit tracking app for fun. It has since gathered a small but active community of users.
