## [](#header-2)MBA World Summit

In 2016, we've helped the [MBA World Summit](http://mbaworldsummit.com/) to double the number of applications and cut internal application handling efforts by 40% by building an application platform incl. payment integration and reallocating campaign budgets based on visitor behavior analysis. ([Check out the result](http://admissions.mbaworldsummit.com/))

## [](#header-2)Value-Centric Product Management (VCPM)

In search of ways to drive business metrics more sustainably we built a measurement framework that describes how features deliver on each of the dimensions in which a product creates user value. In [Product Hours](http://vcpm.org/) we calibrate the framework while helping start-ups with real product challenges.

## [](#header-2)Junto

On a hackathon in 2016, we built a social habit tracking app for fun. It has since gathered a small but active community of users.

## [](#header-2)Appoint

On a weekend in Prague in 2015, we tried to ease the pain that often starts when 3+ people remotely try to find a date and time to meet (Motto: fuck the maybes!). We failed. While users validated the problem, the functional prototype we built during the weekend was not radically improving things.
