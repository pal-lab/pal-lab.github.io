## [](#header-2)Value-Centric Product Management (VCPM)

In 2017 we were looking for ways to drive product success metrics more sustainably and designed a measurement framework that describes how features deliver on each of the dimensions in which a product creates user value. In occasional _Product Hours_, we calibrate the framework while helping start-ups with real product challenges. ([read more](http://vcpm.org/))

## [](#header-2)MBA World Summit

In 2016, we helped the [MBA World Summit](http://mbaworldsummit.com/) to double the number of applications and cut internal application handling efforts by 40% by building an application platform incl. payment integration and analyzing visitor behavior to reallocate marketing campaign budgets. Check it out [here](http://admissions.mbaworldsummit.com/).

## [](#header-2)Appoint

In 2015, we tried to ease the pain that often starts when 3+ people try to find a date and time an appointment on a weekend in Prague (Motto: fuck the maybes!) We failed. While users validated the problem, the functional prototype we built during the weekend was not radically improving things.
