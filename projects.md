## Selected Projects

## [](#header-2)Value-Centric Product Management (VCPM)

In search of ways to drive business metrics more sustainably we built a measurement framework that describes how features deliver on each of the dimensions in which a product creates user value. In *Product Hours* we calibrate the framework while helping start-ups with real product challenges. ([More info](http://vcpm.org/))  


## [](#header-2)MBA World Summit

In 2016, we've helped the [MBA World Summit](http://mbaworldsummit.com/) to double the number of applications and cut internal application handling efforts by 40% by building an application platform incl. payment integration and reallocating campaign budgets based on visitor behavior analysis. ([Check out the result](http://admissions.mbaworldsummit.com/))  


## [](#header-2)Junto
