## [](#header-2)MBA World Summit

We've helped the [MBA World Summit](http://mbaworldsummit.com/) to increase the number of applications by 2x and cut internal application handling efforts by ~40% by building an application platform incl. payment integration and reallocating campaign budgets based on visitor behavior analysis.

## [](#header-2)Layher
For [Layher](http://www.layher-bautechnik.de/en/), we replaced four legacy CRM systems and implemented a cloud-based CRM solution that reduced processing costs for orders by 30%. Our solution also enabled Layher to discover new sales opportunities through pattern recognition in customersâ€™ purchasing data, which contributed to a 25% year-over-year increase in revenue.

## [](#header-2)Value-Centric Product Management (VCPM)

In search of ways to drive business metrics more sustainably we built a measurement framework that describes how features deliver on each of the dimensions in which a product creates user value. In [Product Hours](http://vcpm.org/) we calibrate the framework while helping start-ups with real product challenges.
